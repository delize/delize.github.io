# Personal Website
This is heavily based on the [UOne theme found on ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/item/uone-personal-portfolio-and-resume-template/25005328), however, it has been modified heavily for use with Jekyll/Github Pages.

Feel free to comment on issues or improvements you see.


# Appreciations:
[@MichaelCurrin](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin) - He helped me a lot on some of the larger CSS issues I had when trying to convert this to a Jekyll compatible workflow.
