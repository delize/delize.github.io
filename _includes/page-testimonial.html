                            company during a pandemic. Your help in building and running the necessary Mac scripts to remove all TE management

                        <p>" Timing couldn't be worse for our IT team during the transition to Cisco. I as the leader of the ThousandEyes IT Team went 
                            on paternity leave right in the middle of the most crucial time during the transition. Andrew stepped up the 
                            plate to take over the leadership void that was left. I am proud to have this individual on my team who has really 
                            help(ed) build an amazing IT (team) that has enabled the ThousandEyes to reach many milestones including the M&A with Cisco. Thank you!"</p>

                        <p>" Andrew was able to push forward and successfully complete this (Meeting Room Management) project that solves a big
                        internal issue the company has been having for a while. Andrew worked closely with the Finance team and implemented the
                        asset management (system). Andrew created a detailed and thorough plan to implement a laptop management system, one of
                        the biggest IT challenges we have. "</p>

                        and unreasonable ones haha). It does not go unnoticed or unappreciated!üëç "</p>

                        <p>" Literally within minutes of me placing the request Andrew called me to install the software on my system, which he
                        completed with swift professionalism. ... The speed of fulfillment of the requests and the professionalism demonstrated
                        by each team member along the chain were truly exceptional displays of customer service ‚Äì a feat not easily accomplished
                        in an area as challenging as client support. "</p>

                        years with HFM add-in for excel crashing. Your group probably spent 12 hrs on this issue last year rebuilding profiles,
                        pc‚Äôs etc‚Ä¶, so this will save us all some time. "</p>
